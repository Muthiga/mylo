    <p id="file">Mylo has been in our care for about two and a half years now after being rescued as an infant.<br>
       Unfortunately he cannot be released back into the wild as he cannot survive by himself.<br>
       However he enjoys life to the fullest just as any mokey in the wild does.</p> <br> <br>
    <div class="type">
       <p>Some of the things he loves doing are:</p> 
       <ul class="import">
           <li>Playing around with all the toys he has.</li>
           <li>jumping around on anything he can climb.</li>
           <li>He loves his fruits and will eat just about any fruit he's offered</li>
           <li> He is curious about any and everything and you'll most likely find him inspecting anything new in and around his environment.</li>
